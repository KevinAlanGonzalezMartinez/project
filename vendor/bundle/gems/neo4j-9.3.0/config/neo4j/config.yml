#=== Neo4j.rb configuration settings


# Examples of not using the Neo4j id (neo_id)

# Generated UUID stored as a neo4j property on my_id
#id_property: my_id
#id_property_type: :auto
#id_property_type_value: :uuid

# Example, (probably more useful directly on Neo4j::ActiveNode classes instead as a global configuration)
#id_property: title_id
#id_property_type: :on
#id_property_type_value: :some_method

# TODO
# if identity map should be on or not
# It may impact the performance. Using the identity map will keep all loaded wrapper node/relationship
# object in memory for each thread and transaction - which may speed up or slow down operations.
identity_map: false

# TODO
# When using the Neo4j::Model you can let neo4j automatically set timestamps when updating/creating nodes.
# If set to true neo4j.rb automatically timestamps create and update operations if the model has properties named created_at/created_on or updated_at/updated_on
# (similar to ActiveRecord).
timestamps: true

# Store a property on objects to cache their ActiveNode/ActiveRel class. It prevents each object load from requiring two database queries.
# Strings shorter than 44 characters are classified, so this will have almost no impact on disk footprint. See http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/stable/short-strings.html.
# Alternatively, call class method Neo4j::ActiveNode:cache_class to set this on specific models.
# By default, this property is called _classname, set as symbol to override.
cache_class_names: true
# class_name_property:  :_classname
